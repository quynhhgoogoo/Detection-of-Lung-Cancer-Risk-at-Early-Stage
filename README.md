# Detection of Lung Cancer Risk at Early Stage


## Abstract

Lung Cancer is the third most common cancer in the world and is the leading cause of death cancer. If lung cancer is found at an earlier stage before it is spread and developed, the treatment will have more chance to be successful. However, lung cancer do not usually appear until the disease is at an advanced stage. Even when lung cancer does cause symtomps, people usually ignore it or not treat it seriously. Thus, it is beneficial for people to know if they belong to the group which having high risk of lung cancer and have pre-screening plan to detect it.

This project aim is to help people check if they are at the high risk of having lung cancer and give recommendation for them to check up


## Data Source

The dataset was published in DataWorld, where those data is collected from the website online lung cancer prediction system and get feedback from the user. This site has implemented during period of August 2013 when the people who visited this site.

The total number of data points inside given dataset is 309. There are no missing labels or features in the dataset. The dataset includes a total of 16 columns where each column represents userâ€™s information such as gender, age, smoking history, alcoholic assumption, previous chronic diseases and other corresponding symptoms (coughing, yellow skin, chest pain, etc). 


## Problem Formulation
- Data Points: People who attend the survey
- Features: Users information such as gender, age, chronic disease history, mental health related issues, allergy and their personal behaviors (smoking history, alcoholic assumption)
-  Label: binary value represents if it is a lung cancer(True) or if it is not a lung cancer

## Methods

- Explore the dataset
- Demonstrate the usage of two classification methods in the aformentioned dataset: K-nearest Neighbors algorithm and Logistic Regression (will be introduced in phase 3)
- Compare two methods to each other

##  Access to the report `Report.ipynb`
Required Python packages are `numpy, pandas, seaborn, scikit-learn, matplotlib`
