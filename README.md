# Detection of Lung Cancer at Early Stage

This is the project course for CS-C3240 Machine Learning, Aalto University

## Abstract

Lung Cancer is the third most common cancer in the world for both men and women. It is also the leading cause of death cancer. If lung cancer is found at an earlier stage, when it is small and before it has spread, the treatment has more chance to be successful. However, lung cancer do not usually appear until the disease is at an advanced stage. Even when lung cancer does cause symtomps, people usually ignore it or not treat it seriously. Thus, it is beneficial for people to know if they belong to the group which having high risk of lung cancer and have pre-screening plan to detect it.

This project aim is to help people check if they are at the high risk of having lung cancer and give recommendation for them to check up
